For the first Milestone Project on __Code Institute's Diploma in Software Developement__ course I have created a Yoga website.
Devaki Yoga was born out of my partners passion for yoga, as a qualified Sivananda Yoga teacher it will become the first step in her being able to take her love of yoga to a new level.

## The 5 Planes of User Experience...

## Strategy Plane
---

The website is created as a shop front for the physical yoga studio, where visitors can see more information about the ethos and principles of yoga, while finding relevant timetables, blog posts and contact information.

The main aim is to create a clear, simple, and effective way to engage with the user; information is clear, intuitive and well laid out.

## Scope Plane
---
Features included in this Project

* Three different pages.
* Schedule for classes, and information about the teachers.
* Inspirational images and original content.
* Links to social media, email and phone.

## Structure Plane
---

The website consists of three pages, each having a specific purpose and all formatted intuitively.

* Navigation and Footer

The navigation is repeated through the site for consistency and responsive design is implemented for smaller screens. 
Page indicator is used for feedback and intuitive labeling links to other pages, logo is also a link to the index page.


The footer is repeated through the site for consistency, containing the address, contact information that links to email and phone, social media links and sign-up CTA.

* The "Home" page

The index page features a full viewport responsive image with bootstrap jumbotron heading and company tagline, sign-up CTA, and three testimonials; layout of the page is simple and intuitive and allows immediate interaction.

* About Us

The About Us page introduces more information to the user, photos of the teachers are structured in a way to be casual, responsive design allows specific photos to be shown on smaller screens. The class timetable is simple and clear in its function.

* Blog

The Blog page has information relevant to the site, clear images to support the document, blogs are separated by the sign-up CTA.

## Skeleton Plane
---

The design has been focused on mobile first, while also being responsive to larger screens. The website was designed to allow immediate interaction and to be appropriate to the intended audience.

## Testing

### Browser Testing

The majority of initial browser testing was done through Chrome Developer Tools and Safari's Inspect Elements. The website has been tested on `Safari` and `Google Chrome` across multiple Apple devices, including iMac, Macbook, iPad, iPhone and Android mobile. All tests have confirmed the site performs as intended, it is visually responsive and has good overall device performance.

## User Testing
---

User testing was conducted on slack through the #peer-code-review channel and general feedback was positive.

## Bugs
---
Through validation and user testing, 3 bugs were found:
 * The size of the hero image on index.html was slow to load, this was because of an error in uploading an incorrect image, so was easily fixed by uploading the correct image file.
 * The favicon icon in the header had an incorrect directory, it was redirected and now functions as expected.
* A visibility and accessibilty issue was raised because of a jumbotron font and hero image on the index.html page, this was fixed by adding a background with opacity.

## Responsiveness
---

Google Chrome Dev Tools was used to check the responsiveness of website. Mobile, tablet and desktop sizes were tested and all worked well. 
It also responded well to the Media Query's and no functional or visual errors were found.

## Life Cycle & Further Features
---
* Ability to create accounts, login and book classes in advance.
* Pre paid streaming service with live video of classes.

## Version Control
---

### Git & GitHub

I used **[GitPod](https://gitpod.io/)** as a local repository and IDE and **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** as a remote repository. The process of version control was:

* First i created a new repository on GitHub 
* I have then opened that repository on GitPod and started coding
* In GitPod i have created all the pages and and folders 
* I was then saving my work and pushing it to GitHub repository to keep it safe
* The process I used for checking, saving, commiting and pushing it to remote repository is:
    * `git status` for checking and displaying the state of the repository and staging area
   * `git add . `  for adding work to git
    * `git commit -m "Commit message" ` used for saving changes
    * `git push ` used to upload content to a Github

## Deployment
---

To deploy the website on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
1. Go to **"Settings"** in the repository
2. In **"Source"** of **"GitHub Pages"**, select **"master** for Branch and click save
3. The website is now published on GitHub Pages and the link is provided on on the same section
